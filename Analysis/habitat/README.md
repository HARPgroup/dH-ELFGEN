1. single_site_query.R for querying IFIM tables
2. hab_ts_functions.R houses several habitat time series functions
3. single_site_analysis.Rmd
   1. generates a word doc of detailed single-site, single-metric plots 
   2. glo and ghi can be changed on a site-by-site basis in the file “ifim_sites_df.txt” 
   3. running this code will also generate 2 csv outputs that may be useful
      1. One csv with ELF metric percent changes for 5,10,20,30,40,50% flow reductions 
      2. One csv with IFIM metric percent changes for 5,10,20,30,40,50% flow reductions 
4. single_site_boxplots.R
   1. Loops through all IFIM sites outputting images of monthly boxplots of percent habitat change
   2. Also outputs csv of percent habitat change by month for each habitat metric studied at that site
5. multi_site_by_DA.R
   1. Generates a single plot of site habitat change percentiles organized by drainage area 
   2. *Note: you need to run the code above prior to running this one, since it uses the csvs generated by “single_site_boxplots.R” as inputs
