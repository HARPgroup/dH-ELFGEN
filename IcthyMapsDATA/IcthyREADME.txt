Robert Burgholzer and Joseph Kliener at VA DEQ

These data originate from Emmanuel Frimpong, Jian Huang, and Yu Liang, 2015, Historical Stream Fish Distribution Database for the Conterminous United States (1950-1990): IchthyMaps.
The data tables here are a subset of the original data release for use in Virginia and the region surrounding it.  

Frimpong_etal_2015_IcthymapsVA_region.csv  = subset of IcthyMaps data with all taxa presence records used in this work. 

Frimpong_etal_2015_IchthyMaps_v1_METADATA.xml = metadata from ScienceBase data release for the full dataset. 

IcthymapsVA_region_NT_TotalComID.csv = the total number of taxa calculated for the regional dataset. 

IcthymapsVA_region_NT_TotalComID_MAF_summarized.csv  = the total number of taxa calculated for the regional dataset, 
but with annual and monthly streamflow values assigned from the NHDPlux V2. 
This file has a narrower extent and only includes HUC8 drainages that directly drain into or out of Virginia.
  
IcthymapsVA_region_NT_TotalComID_summarized_METADATA.xml = metadata associated with the IcthymapsVA_region_NT_TotalComID_summarized.csv file


Data tables can be joined to the NHDPlus V2 for display of river reaches that had presence data for fish between 1950 - 1990.
